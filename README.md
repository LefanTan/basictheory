### A informative website that contains basic guitar theory 

First time developing a web app, and also the first time I'm developing using React and so far it has been really fun. 

I thought that it would be really cool if there is a website that displays information about basic guitar theory such as different chord voicings, functions, scales, progression etc. There is a really cool website called [oolimo](https://www.oolimo.com/) that does all these things already, they also have way more functionality and details. I chose to made this website as I thought there could be more intuitive ways to display/visualize information. 

Since this is a one man job, some of the information might be incorrect, feel free to let me know by making an issue report.
