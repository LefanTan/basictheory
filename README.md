# Basictheory.io

First time developing a web app, and also the first time I'm developing using React and so far it has been really fun. 

I thought that it would be really cool if there is a website that displays information about basic guitar theory such as different chord voicings, functions, scales, progression etc. There is a really cool website called [oolimo](https://www.oolimo.com/) that does all these things already, they also have way more functionality and details. One difference is that the Chords in basictheory.io is sectioned by Major / Minor / Suspended etc, I find that that makes for a much easier navigating. 

Since this is a one man job, some of the information might be wrong, feel free to let me know. 

EDIT: Extremely buggy on IOS (chrome or safari) but works just fine on Android/ Windows Browser
