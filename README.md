### A informative website that contains basic guitar theory 

First time developing any sort of web app, and also the first time I'm developing using React and so far it has been really fun. 

I thought that it would be really cool if there is a website that displays information about basic guitar theory such as different chord voicings, functions, scales, progression etc. There is a really cool website called [oolimo](https://www.oolimo.com/) that does all these things already, they also have way more functionality and details. I chose to made this website as I thought there could be more intuitive ways to display/visualize information. 

Since this is a one man job, some of the information might be incorrect, feel free to let me know by making an issue report. 


## Learning Points

since this is the first time I've done any js/react/html/css, there's many technical debts to work on

1. accessibility
2. semantics html
3. api key not in .env
